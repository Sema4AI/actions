# Build MCP Tools or AI Actions that connect AI Agents with the real-world - all in 🐍 Python.

Sema4.ai is the easiest way to extend the capabilities of AI agents, assistants and copilots with custom actions, written in Python. Create and deploy tools, skills, loaders and plugins that securely connect any AI Assistant platform to your data and applications.

Sema4.ai Action Server makes your Python scripts compatible with Agents using protocols such as [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), OpenAI's [custom GPTs](https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor), [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/robocorp/) and [OpenGPTs](https://github.com/langchain-ai/opengpts) by automatically creating and exposing an API based on function declaration, type hints and docstrings. Just create your `@tool` (or `@action`) and start!

# 🏃‍♂️ Quickstart

There are two main ways using the Action Server: with the command line, or with our VS Code extension. This section gets you going!

<details open>
<summary><b>Install from PyPI</b></summary>

Using an existing Python installation, run:

```sh
pip install sema4ai-action-server
```

After installed the `action-server` executable should be in the `Scripts` or `bin`
(depending on the OS) for the given python installation/environment.

</details>

Alternatively, it's also possible to download the Action Server as a standalone
binary for a specific platform:

<details>
<summary><b>CLI For macOS</b></summary>

```sh
brew update
brew install sema4ai/tools/action-server
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>CLI For Windows</b></summary>

```sh
# Download Sema4.ai Action Server
curl -o action-server.exe https://cdn.sema4.ai/action-server/releases/latest/windows64/action-server.exe
```

You can download/move the executable into a folder that is in your `PATH`, or you can [add the folder into PATH](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/) so that you can call `action-server` wherever you are.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>CLI For Linux</b></summary>

```sh
# Download Sema4.ai Action Server
curl -o action-server https://cdn.sema4.ai/action-server/releases/latest/linux64/action-server
chmod a+x action-server

# Add to PATH or move to a folder that is in PATH
sudo mv action-server /usr/local/bin/
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Sema4.ai SDK extension for VS Code</b></summary>

After installing [Sema4.ai SDK extension from the VS Code Markeplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sema4ai.sema4ai), open the Command Palette (`Command-Shift-P` or `Ctrl-Shift-P`) and select `Sema4.ai: Create Action Package`. This will bootstrap a new project. You can then run/debug indvidual Actions from the Extension's sidebar, or start the Action Server.

![github-extension](./docs/include/create-action-package.png)

</details>

<br/>

Bootstrap a new project from a template. You’ll be prompted for the name of the project:

```sh
action-server new
```

Navigate to the freshly created project folder and start the server:

```sh
cd my-project
action-server start
```

👉 You should now have an Action Server running locally at: http://localhost:8080, to open the web UI.

👉 The `MCP` endpoint is available at: `http://localhost:8080/mcp`.

👉 Using the --auto-reload -flag for developing the Action Server will automatically reload your tools/actions when you change them during development.

Head over to [Action Server docs](./action_server/README.md) for more.

# What makes a Python function an MCP Tool or ⚡️Action?

1️⃣ `package.yaml` file that describes the `MCP/Action Package` you are working on, and defines up your **Python environment and dependencies**:

```yaml
spec-version: v2

name: Package name
description: Package description
documentation: https://github.com/...

dependencies:
  conda-forge:
    - python=3.12.10
    - uv=0.6.11
  pypi:
    - sema4ai-actions=1.3.15
    - sema4ai-mcp=0.0.1
    - pytz=2024.1

pythonpath:
  - src
  - tests

dev-dependencies:
  pypi:
    - pytest=8.3.3

dev-tasks:
  test: pytest tests

packaging:
  exclude:
    - ./.git/**
    - ./.vscode/**
    - ./devdata/**
    - ./output/**
    - ./venv/**
    - ./.venv/**
    - ./.DS_store/**
    - ./**/*.pyc
    - ./**/*.zip
    - ./**/.env
    - ./**/__MACOSX
    - ./**/__pycache__
    - ./**/.git
    - ./node_modules/**
```

<details>
  <summary>🙋‍♂️ "Why not just pip install...?"</summary>

Think of this as an equivalent of the requirements.txt, but much better. 👩‍💻 With `package.yaml` you are not just controlling your PyPI dependencies, you control the complete Python environment, which makes things repeatable and easy.

👉 You will probably not want run the Actions just on your machine, so by using `package.yaml`:

- You can avoid `Works on my machine` -cases
- You do not need to manage Python installations on all the machines
- You can control exactly which version of Python your automation will run on
  - ..as well as the pip or uv version to avoid dependency resolution changes
- No need for venv, pyenv, ... tooling and knowledge sharing inside your team.
- Define dependencies in `package.yaml` and let our tooling do the heavy lifting.
- You get all the content of [conda-forge](https://prefix.dev/channels/conda-forge) without any extra tooling

> The environment management is provided by [RCC](https://github.com/robocorp/rcc).

2️⃣ [@tool decorator](./mcp) or [@action decorator](./action) that determines the **tool or action entry point** and [Type hints and docstring](./actions#describe-your-action) to let AI agents know **what the Tool/Action does** in natural language

Note: any function decorated as `@action` imported from `sema4ai.actions` is also available as a `@tool` imported from `sema4ai.mcp` and vice-versa (besides, there are other custom decorators for other functionalities such as `@resource`, `@prompt` for mcp and `@query` for actions).

```py
from sema4ai.mcp import tool

@tool
def greeting(name: str) -> str:
    """
    Greets the user

    Args:
        name (str): The user name

    Returns:
        str: Final user greeting
    """
```

## Connect using an MCP client

Once you have started the Action Server, point the client to the **Action Server** `/mcp` endpoint
(example: `http://localhost:8080/mcp`).

Note: in production, the `Action Server` should be put under a reverse proxy that controls SSL and authentication.

<div id="connect-gpt"></div>
## Connect with OpenAI GPTs Actions

For testing with a GPTs actions, it's possible to start the `Action Server` with the `--expose` flag.

Once you have started the Action Server with `--expose` flag, you’ll get a URL available to the public, along with the authentication token. The relevant part of the output from the terminal looks like this, of course with your own details:

```sh
...
Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
🌍 URL: https://seventy-six-helpless-dragonflies.sema4ai.link
🔑 Add following header api authorization header to run actions: { "Authorization": "Bearer xxx_xxx" }
```

<h3 id="actions-video" align="center">
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aq6QDCaUmA">
    👉 Example video in Youtube 👈
  </a>
</h3>

Adding the Action Server-hosted AI Action to your custom GPT is super simple: basically just navigate to “Actions” section of the GPT configuration, add the link to import the actions, and **Add Authentication** with **Authentication method** set to _“API key”_ and **Auth Type** to _“Bearer”_.

> **TIP:**
> Use the `@action(is_consequential=False)` flag to avoid the user needing to accept the action execution separately each time on your GPT.

Sema4.ai stack is hands down the easiest way to give AI agents more capabilities. It’s an end-to-end stack supporting every type of connection between AI and your apps and data. You are in control where to run the code and everything is built for easiness, security, and scalability.

- 🔐 **Decouple AI and Actions that touches your data/apps** - Clarity and security with segregation of duties between your AI agent and code that touches your data and apps. Build `@tool` or `@action` and use from multiple AI frameworks.
- 🏎️ **Develop Actions faster with Sema4.ai's `robocorp` automation libraries** - [Robocorp libraries](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp) and the Python ecosystem lets you act on anything - from data to API to Browser to Desktops.
- 🕵️ **Observability out of the box** - Log and trace every `@tool` or `@action` run automatically without a single `print` statement. _Pro tip: connect [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith) traces with Action logs!_
- 🤯 **No-pain Python environment management** - Don't do [this](https://xkcd.com/1987/). Sema4.ai manages a full Python environment for your actions with ease.
- 🚀 **Deploy with zero config and infra** - One step deployment, and you'll be connecting your `@tool` to MCP clients or `@action` to AI apps like Langchain and OpenAI GPTs in seconds.
