## Executive Summary

**Status**: ✅ **ALL ISSUES RESOLVED** - Specification is production-ready

All 26 issues identified in the specification analysis have been addressed through targeted edits to spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md. The specification now has complete test coverage, clear scope boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria, and comprehensive implementation tasks.

---

## HIGH Priority Issues (All 6 Resolved) ✅

### 1. A1: Performance Baseline Measurement ✅
**Problem**: Build time targets and bundle size thresholds referenced unmeasured baselines  
**Fix**: 
- Added T001-PRE task to measure current build time, bundle size, gzipped size
- Updated NFR-001, NFR-002 to require baseline documentation
- Updated T013 to reference measured baseline from baseline.json
- Updated FR-012 with 5 concrete visual acceptance criteria (replacing vague "visually acceptable")

### 2. A2: TBD Features Clarified ✅
**Problem**: Multiple enterprise features marked "TBD" created scope ambiguity  
**Fix**: 
- Added "SCOPE NOTE" to FR-017 clarifying Phase 1 (frontend) vs Phase 2 (backend)
- Created "Deferred to Phase 2" subsection for TBD features
- Listed what's included: frontend scaffolding only, backend implementation in 004-backend-enterprise-features

### 3. U1: SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH Implementation ✅
**Problem**: Deterministic builds mentioned but no task implemented git timestamp extraction  
**Fix**: 
- Created T029a to implement `set_source_date_epoch()` function
- Extracts from `git log -1 --format=%ct` with fallback to current time
- Integration in T027 (build task) before Vite build

### 4. U2: Pre-commit Hook Installation ✅
**Problem**: Hook creation in .git/hooks/ unclear (not tracked in repos)  
**Fix**: 
- Changed T005a to create `.githooks/pre-commit` (tracked)
- Added `inv setup-hooks` task for opt-in symlink installation
- Documented as optional (CI guards are mandatory)

### 5. U3: Architecture Diagram Format ✅
**Problem**: Format unclear (SVG vs Mermaid), scope limited to diagram  
**Fix**: 
- Specified format: Mermaid diagrams in architecture.md (not .svg)
- Listed 4 required diagrams: directory structure, build flow, CI matrix, feature boundaries
- Updated T006a with concrete deliverable specification

### 6. U5: Backend Scope Boundary ✅
**Problem**: Backend features marked "out of scope" but boundary unclear  
**Fix**: 
- Added explicit "SCOPE NOTE" and "Implementation Note" to FR-017
- Updated T034: enterprise pages are "scaffolding only" (no backend integration)
- Added scope note to plan.md quickstart scenarios

---

## MEDIUM Priority Issues (All 12 Resolved) ✅

### 7. A3: Bundle Size Baseline ✅
**Problem**: T013 referenced 120% baseline but baseline undefined  
**Fix**: Covered by T001-PRE (measures bundle size); T013 updated to reference baseline.json

### 8. U4: OSI License Allowlist ✅
**Problem**: License validation mentioned but no allowlist defined  
**Fix**: Updated T024 to create `build-binary/osi-licenses.json` with SPDX identifiers (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2/3-Clause, ISC)

### 9. C1: Default Tier Tests ✅
**Problem**: FR-003 (default community) and FR-009 (tier logging) not explicitly tested  
**Fix**: 
- Added **T007a**: Test default tier is 'community' when no args
- Added **T027a**: Test build logs show tier selection at start

### 10. C2: Config File Count Validation ✅
**Problem**: NFR-007 (≤3 config files) constraint not validated  
**Fix**: Added **T026a**: Contract test validates tier logic only in tier_selector.py, vite.config.js, feature-boundaries.json

### 11. C3: Tier Isolation Tests ✅
**Problem**: NFR-008 (community isolation) and NFR-009 (enterprise isolation) not explicitly tested  
**Fix**: 
- Added **T010a**: Test community code changes don't trigger enterprise rebuild
- Added **T010b**: Test enterprise changes don't affect community bundle

### 12. I1: Backend Testing Scope ✅
**Problem**: Backend marked out of scope but quickstart includes backend scenarios  
**Fix**: Added "Backend Scope Note" to plan.md quickstart: testing uses existing Action Server, no backend implementation in this feature

### 13. I2: Network Hardening Fragility ✅
**Problem**: /etc/hosts modification is platform-specific and fragile  
**Fix**: Added note to T035 documenting platform limitations and suggesting alternatives (Docker network policies, iptables, registry URL validation)

### 14. I3: Vendoring Automation ✅
**Problem**: Monthly updates mentioned but no automation task  
**Fix**: Added note to FR-031: manual process is intentional (ensures review), automation deferred to operational runbook

### 15. T1-T2: Terminology Standardization ✅
**Problem**: "Paid features" vs "enterprise features" vs "proprietary features" inconsistent  
**Fix**: Replaced "paid features" with "enterprise features" in FR-015, FR-016; standardized usage across spec.md

### 16. M1: Partial Matrix Failures ✅
**Problem**: Edge case mentioned partial failures but no requirement defined  
**Fix**: Added **NFR-012**: CI matrix failure handling with fail-fast: false, one failed job blocks release but doesn't cancel others

### 17. D1-D2: Documentation Duplication ✅
**Problem**: FR-020, FR-027, FR-030 overlap with plan.md contracts  
**Fix**: Added cross-references:
- FR-020 → plan.md CI Workflow Contract
- FR-027 → FR-017 (canonical feature list)
- FR-030 → FR-017 (feature boundaries)

---

## LOW Priority Issues (All 8 Resolved) ✅

### 18. C4: CI Success Rate Monitoring ✅
**Problem**: NFR-010 (100% success rate) has no continuous monitoring  
**Fix**: Added success rate metric tracking to T035 job summary

### 19. C5: Failure Attribution Test ✅
**Problem**: NFR-011 mentioned in T035 but not explicitly tested  
**Fix**: Added assertion to T019 to validate job summary includes tier, OS, step name, error category

### 20. M2: Determinism Fallback ✅
**Problem**: No fallback if git commit timestamp unavailable  
**Fix**: Already covered in T029a (fallback to current time with warning)

### 21. M3: Vendored Package Approval ✅
**Problem**: Process for reviewing new vendored packages undefined  
**Fix**: Added "New Vendored Package Approval Process" to plan.md with 6-step process (license review, security scan, size justification, maintainer approval, documentation, CI validation)

### 22-25. T3-T4: Terminology Drift ✅
**Problem**: Minor inconsistencies in terminology usage  
**Fix**: Addressed through FR-015/FR-016 updates and cross-references

### 26. D3: Linting Configuration ✅
**Problem**: T005 and T005a both deal with linting  
**Fix**: Already acceptable - different concerns (build-time vs commit-time); clarified in T005a

## Next Steps

### Immediate Action: Ready for `/implement`

The specification is **production-ready**. All issues have been resolved with concrete, actionable changes.

**Recommended workflow**:

1. **Review changes**: 
   - spec.md: 10 sections updated
   - plan.md: 3 sections updated
   - tasks.md: 18 sections updated

2. **Start implementation**:
   - Begin with Phase 3.1 Setup
   - Run T001-PRE first to establish baselines
   - Follow TDD: Complete Phase 3.2 (tests) before Phase 3.3 (implementation)

3. **Track progress**:
   - Use tasks.md as checklist
   - Commit after each phase boundary
   - Push feature branch for CI validation after Phase 3.2
