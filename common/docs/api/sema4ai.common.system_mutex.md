# module `sema4ai.common.system_mutex`

To use, create a SystemMutex, check if it was acquired (get_mutex_aquired()) and if acquired the mutex is kept until the instance is collected or release_mutex is called.

I.e.:

mutex = SystemMutex('my_unique_name')if mutex.get_mutex_aquired():print('acquired')else:print('not acquired')

Or to keep trying to get the mutex until a given timeout elapses:

with timed_acquire_mutex('mutex_name'):# Do something without any racing condition with other processes...

:param check_reentrant: Should only be False if this mutex is expected to be released ina different thread.
