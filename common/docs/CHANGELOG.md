# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 0.2.1 - 2025-08-21

- CVE fixes

## 0.2.0 - 2025-07-29

- Use the same code (with psutil) in all platforms for `kill_process_and_subprocesses`.

## 0.1.1 - 2025-06-02

- Fix issue when killing subprocesses on MacOS (apparently in MacOS we could
  end in a state where killing subprocesses could end up killing parent processes --
  i.e.: PyCharm was killed when a subprocess was killed using `kill_process_and_subprocesses`
  -- it's not entirely clear why that happened, but the new code using psutil doesn't
  seem to suffer from the issue, and shouldn't be an issue since we already
  rely on psutil anyways in this library).
