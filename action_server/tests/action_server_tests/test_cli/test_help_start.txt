options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a ADDRESS, --address ADDRESS
                        Server address (default: localhost)
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Server port (default: 8080)
  --expose              Expose the server to the world
  --server-url SERVER_URL
                        Explicit server url to be defined in the OpenAPI spec
                        'servers' section. Defaults to the localhost url.
  --expose-allow-reuse  Always answer yes to expose reuse confirmation
  --api-key API_KEY     Adds authentication. Pass it as `{"Authorization":
                        "Bearer <API_KEY>"}` header. Pass `--api-key None` to
                        disable authentication.
  --actions-sync ACTIONS_SYNC
                        By default the actions will be synchronized
                        (added/removed) given the directories provided (if not
                        specified the current directory is used). To start
                        without synchronizing it's possible to use `--actions-
                        sync=false`
  --dir PATH            By default, when starting, actions will be collected
                        from the current directory to serve, but it's also
                        possible to use `--dir` to load actions from a
                        different directory
  --skip-lint           Skip `@action` linting when an action is found (by
                        default any `@action` is linted for errors when
                        found).
  --min-processes MIN_PROCESSES
                        The minimum number of action processes that should
                        always be kept alive, ready to process any incoming
                        request.
  --max-processes MAX_PROCESSES
                        The maximum number of processes that may be created to
                        handle the actions.
  --reuse-processes     By default actions are run once and then after the
                        action runs the process that ran the action exits.
                        This can be changed by using --reuse-processes. With
                        this flag, after running the action instead of exiting
                        the process will be available to run another action in
                        the same process (note that in this case care must be
                        taken so that memory leakage does not happen in the
                        action and that global state from one run does not
                        interfere with a subsequent run).
  --full-openapi-spec   By default, the public OpenAPI specification will
                        include only endpoints to run individual actions and
                        omit all other endpoints. With this flag, all
                        endpoints available will be defined in the public
                        OpenAPI specification.
  --auto-reload         When specified changes to Action Packages will be
                        automatically picked up by the Action Server.
  --parent-pid PARENT_PID
                        The parent pid for the action server (when the parent
                        pid exits, the action server will automatically exit).
  --https               Starts the action server using https. If no
                        certificate is provided, a self signed certificate
                        will be created and used.
  --ssl-self-signed     When using `--https`, a self-signed certificate will
                        be created and used.
  --ssl-keyfile [PATH]  When using `--https` can be used to specify the key
                        file containing the private key for the SSL.
  --ssl-certfile [PATH]
                        When using `--https` can be used to specify the
                        certificate (which contains the public key for the
                        SSL).
  --oauth2-settings [PATH]
                        A yaml file with the OAuth2 settings with a mapping
                        from the provider name to the provider information
                        (such as clientId and clientSecret).
  -d PATH, --datadir PATH
                        Directory to store the data for operating the actions
                        server (by default a datadir will be generated based
                        on the current directory).
  --db-file DB_FILE     The name of the database file, relative to the datadir
                        (default: server.db)
  --kill-lock-holder    Kill the process holding the data directory lock file
                        if it exists.
  -v, --verbose         Be more talkative (default: False)
  --whitelist WHITELIST
                        Allows whitelisting the actions/packages to be used
