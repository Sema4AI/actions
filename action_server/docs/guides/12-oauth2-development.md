## Configuring OAuth2

In this case, a developer must create an application in the proper service
(say, `google` and `slack`), and fill in the details in the `OAuth2 Settings YAML`.

- On Windows it's default location is `%LOCALAPPDATA%/sema4ai/action-server/oauth2-settings.yaml`.
- On Linux/Mac it's default location is `~/.sema4ai/action-server/oauth2-settings.yaml`.
- It's also possible to specify a different `oauth2-settings.yaml` location in the `start` arguments.

Below is an example showing how to configure it.

Keep in mind that the `devServerInfo` information is only used from VSCode to
launch the action server to collect OAuth2 data.

```yaml
# Details for each provider need to be manually set.
#
# The following providers just require "clientId" and "clientSecret":
# - google, github, slack, and hubspot
#
# The following providers require "server", "clientId" and "clientSecret":
# - microsoft, zendesk
#
# Any other provider besides those also needs to specify
# "server", "tokenEndpoint" and "authorizationEndpoint"
#
# Note: if the "tokenEndpoint"/"authorizationEndpoint" are relative,
# the "server" is prefixed to it to get the absolute version.
google:
  clientId: "XXXX-YYYYYYYYY.apps.googleusercontent.com"
  clientSecret: "XXXXX-yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy"

slack:
  clientId: "XXXXXXXXXXXX.YYYYYYYYYYY"
  clientSecret: "zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"

hubspot:
  clientId: "xxxxxx-yyyyy-zzzz-aaaa-bbbbbbbbbbbbb"
  clientSecret: "xxxxxx-yyyyy-zzzz-aaaa-bbbbbbbbbbbbb"

microsoft:
  clientId: "xxxxxx-yyyyy-zzzz-aaaa-bbbbbbbbbbbbb"
  clientSecret: "xxxxxx-yyyyy-zzzz-aaaa-bbbbbbbbbbbbb"
  server: "https://<service.microft.com>"

custom:
  clientId: "xxxxxx-yyyyy-zzzz-aaaa-bbbbbbbbbbbbb"
  clientSecret: "xxxxxx-yyyyy-zzzz-aaaa-bbbbbbbbbbbbb"
  server: "https://<service.microft.com>"

# The information below is only used to require tokens from VSCode:
#
# This is the server information which will be used to create a server
# which will be used to collect the OAuth2 tokens as needed.
# Note that this is ONLY USED WHEN tokens are requested from 
# a separate application, such as VSCode, as when the action
# server is manually started it'll use host/port provided when
# it was initialized.
devServerInfo:
  datadir: "./oauth2-datadir"
  redirectUri: "https://localhost:4567"
  # If the redirectUri starts with `https`, ssl information is
  # needed. In this case it's possible to either set `sslSelfSigned`
  # to true to automatically create a self-signed certificate or
  # set the `sslKeyfile` and `sslCertfile` to be used to serve
  # the page.
  #
  # Note: the redirectUri needs to be specified here and in the service.
  # Keep in mind that the port must not be used by any other service
  # in the machine.
  #
  # Disclaimer: if using a self-signed certificate, the browser may complain
  # and an exception needs to be accepted to proceed to the site unless
  # the self-signed certificate is imported in the system.
  sslSelfSigned: true
  sslKeyfile: ""
  sslCertfile: ""
```
