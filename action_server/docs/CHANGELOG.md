# Changelog

## Unreleased

- A new argument: `--parent-pid` can be passed to the action server. When passed,
  the action server will automatically exit when the given parent pid is no longer
  alive (it's meant to be used when the action server is embedded into another app).
- Standardized the lock file to always start with `PID: {os.getpid()}\n`.

## 0.12.1 - 2024-05-31

- Fix issue where keyring backend was not loaded properly with Windows and MacOS

## 0.12.0 - 2024-05-29

- Add new command: cloud
  - Subcommand: login
    - Save the Control Room login information to keyring, the access credentials and the hostname
  - Subcommand: verify-login
    - Verify if the user credentials have been saved to the keyring
  - Subcommand: list-organizations
    - List all available organization with given access credentials
- Add new package subcommand
  - publish, publish action package to Control Room
    - Intended for human user to handle the whole publish pipeline
  - Subcommands intended for CI users that handles the publish pipeline without interaction:
    - push, upload the action package to Control Room
    - status, query the action package publish status
    - set-changelog, update the action package changelog to Control Room
- `sema4ai.link` is now used on `--expose`

## 0.11.0 - 2024-05-23

- Improved support for exceptions raised in `@action`s from `sema4ai-actions`.
- Note: `sema4ai-actions 0.8.0` added `ActionError` and `Response` classes
  to the public API for improved handling of error conditions.
- See: [Structuring actions guide](./guides/09-structuring-actions.md) for more information.
- `list-templates` subcommand is now available for the `new` command, allowing to get the list of available Action templates
  - subcommand can be used with `--json` flag, which will format the output as JSON
- In the builtin view, added a link to see logs from a run where the run is done.

## 0.10.0 - 2024-05-20

- A `version` is now available in the metadata to signal the current version of the metadata format.
- `openapi.json` (also provided in the metadata): now has an `info/version` field with the version of the `Action Server` (previously it was always `0.1.0`).
- The `action-server package metadata` now has an `--output-file` parameter which allows writing to a file.
- In the `action-server package build`, a file named `__action_server_metadata__.json` is added to the root of the `.zip` with the metadata contents.
- `new` command allows to choose a template from a predefined list now. Command will list available templates,
  and prompt user to choose one.
  - `--template` argument has been added, allowing to specify a concrete template when running the command (when specified,
    user won't be prompted to choose a template from the list).
  - Note: this is a **backward incompatible** change (clients using `action-server new --name <name>` must upgrade
    to pass a template name, otherwise the command will appear to be stuck and will not create anything while waiting for
    an input).

## 0.9.1 - 2024-05-17

- Accept passing `OAuth2 secrets` (as a dict with the required keys) in the `/api/secrets`.

## 0.9.0 - 2024-05-16

- The default datadirs will now be created in `~/.sema4ai/action-server`
  or `LOCALAPPDATA/sema4ai/action-server` instead of `~/robocorp/.action_server`
  or `LOCALAPPDATA/robocorp/action_server`.
  Note that this is a **backward incompatible** change. Users can move the contents
  of the old dir to the new dir to keep existing information (a warning is shown
  from the action server notifying users about it if the old directory exists).
- The `SEMA4AI_HOME` environment variable can now be used to set a different home
  folder to store the `action-server` information (default datadirs).
- OAuth2 Secrets can now be passed to the action server

  - **Important**: Requires `sema4ai-actions 0.6.0` onwards to work.
  - Secrets are received as parameters in an `@action`.
  - The metadata generated by `action-server package metadata` now includes information on OAuth2 secrets required.
  - OAuth2 secrets can be sent the same way that regular secrets are sent, with the only difference
    that instead of having a payload where the value is a string, the payload is a dict with the following
    keys: `"provider", "scopes", "access_token", "metadata"`.
  - Example showing an `@action` requiring an OAuth2 secret:

  ```python
  from typing import Literal
  from sema4ai.actions import OAuth2Secret, action

  @action
  def read_spreadsheet(
      name: str,
      google_secret: OAuth2Secret[
          Literal["google"],
          list[
              Literal[
                  "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly",
                  "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly",
              ]
          ],
      ],
  ) -> str:
      return do_read_spreadsheet(name, google_secret.access_token)
  ```

  - See the secrets guide for more information.

## 0.8.1 - 2024-05-09

- Action package names are now properly validated when setting secrets through `/api/secrets`.

## 0.8.0 - 2024-05-08

- Secret information is now available in the package metadata.
  - **Important**: requires `sema4ai-actions 0.5.0`
  - Note: this is a **backward-incompatible** change in `sema4ai-actions 0.5.0` as secrets are now required to be documented.
- Fixed brew reference to `sema4ai/tools/action-server` in conda wrapper.
- The internal database (which keeps information on the runs, etc) is now auto-migrated, so, the
  separate `migrate` command does not need to be manually called.
  - Note: The action server will now check the internal database version and if it's newer than
    the current expected version it'll notify the user and abort the startup.

## 0.7.0 - 2024-05-06

- A new API (`/api/secrets`) is now available to set secrets in memory which will later
  be passed on to actions when they're run (those are later passed using the `x-action-context`
  -- it's meant to be used in cases where a process is managing the action server but is
  not intercepting requests to set the `x-action-context` as would be needed to set the secrets).
  - Note: a new call for a given action package will override previous secrets given for the
    same action package.

## 0.6.0 - 2024-05-02

- It's possible to use `@action(display_name="<Action name>")` to specify a different
  summary in the openapi.json (the default is using the action signature name
  replacing '\_' by spaces and making it a title).
  - Note: require `sema4ai-actions 0.4.0`.
- Error message is properly shown when trying to bind the action server to a port
  which is already being used.
- Actions from action packages that are no longer available are disabled when actions
  are synchronized.
- The `ROBOCORP_HOME` is no longer set to be inside of the datadir (users can set
  the home using the environment variable when needed).
- Passing `--no-retry-build` to RCC when building the environment.
- RCC updated to `v17.28.4`.
- Created command: `action-server env clean-tools-caches`.
- `.pyc` files are now written (passing `--no-pyc-management` to RCC).
- The environment is built only once and is no longer checked/made pristine
  whenever the action server is started.

## 0.5.3 - 2024-04-24

- Properly work with `uv` (to use add `uv=<version>` in the `conda-forge` section).

## 0.5.2 - 2024-04-24

- Fixed issue in Windows binary build signing.

## 0.5.0 - 2024-04-23

- Branding change: `Robocorp Action Server` is now `Sema4.ai Action Server`.
- `robocorp-actions` is now deprecated and `sema4ai.actions` should
  be used instead (temporarily `robocorp-actions` is still accepted, but
  it'll be deprecated soon).
- `auth-tag` is now properly used in the `X-Action-Context`, but
  `sema4ai-actions=0.3.1` is required in the environment.

## 0.4.1 - 2024-04-17

- `auth-tag` can be passed/used in the `X-Action-Context` header when encoding using `aes256-gcm` encryption.
  - Note: requires `robocorp-actions=0.2.1`
  - Note: actually has an issue (auth-tag still not properly supported).

## 0.4.0 - 2024-04-16

- Using `Ctrl+C` to stop action server should no longer show a traceback.
- Return package name in package metadata.
- Return package description in package metadata.
- RCC updated to `v17.23.2`.
- RCC `--bundled` flag now passed when called from the action server.
- When the help is shown the action server version is shown in the description.
- (Backward-Incompatibility) The label referencing the encryption algorithm for the context is now properly specified as `aes256-gcm`.
- Note: New migration required with data related to required secrets (`action-server migrate` needs to be manually called).
- Action Server Builtin UI:
  - Fix issue where the label for some entry would not be shown in the run. [#370](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp/issues/370)
  - Show ` (item)` when editing an item from a list.
  - Required secrets are now properly shown in the UI (so, it's possible to pass secrets from the Builtin UI).

## 0.3.2 - 2024-04-12

- Fixed issue where auto-update message could break commands which wrote to stdout (such as version or package metadata).

## 0.3.1 - 2024-04-11

- Fixes in the builtin UI:
  - There's a JSON toggle so that the data can be sent as JSON.
  - Objects can now be properly edited.
  - Entering a float or int now works properly.

## 0.3.0 - 2024-04-10

- `action-server package metadata` now includes information on the secrets required
  for each action.
- Passing secrets now works (requires `robocorp-actions=0.2.0`)
  - Note: the builtin UI still has no support for passing secrets.

## 0.2.1 - 2024-04-04

- `action-server package build` no longer includes the `.zip` being created in the
  `.zip` itself if it's created in the current directory.
- `action-server package extract` uses the current dir by default as a target for
  extraction.
- A traceback is no longer shown if the user does `Ctrl+C` when waiting for the
  user input on whether to override or not files in the related
  `action-server package` commands.
- Fixed issue where items could be overridden in the `action-server package` commands
  even if the user answered `n` to the prompt.

## 0.2.0 - 2024-04-03

- Update package's main README.
- Improved handling of websockets when used from the builtin UI (not the `--expose` one).
  - Fixed issue where the number of runs shown in the UI would not match the
    actual number of runs (i.e.: updated data was not collected on websocket
    reconnection).
- Fixed issue where `"sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked"` could be raised
  when executing multiple actions in parallel.
- In `action-server start --expose`, if an action run starts and the connection
  is broken and a new websocket connection is created to the tunnel, the results
  of the action run are sent to the new websocket.
- Added support for `action-server package build` to create a .zip file with the
  package contents (excluding contents based on the `package.yaml` `packaging/exclude`
  session).
- Added support for `action-server package extract` to extract the contents of the
  package created with `action-server package build`.
- Added support for `action-server package metadata` to extract metadata from the
  action package (in the current directory). Currently outputs to stdout
  a json containing a map from `openapi.json` to its contents.
- Backward-incompatibility: `action-server package update` needs to be used
  instead of `action-server package --update`.
- Add support parsing Array type in Action Server UI action run view

## 0.1.4 - 2024-03-20

- Fixed issue in action-server binary build.

## 0.1.3 - 2024-03-20

- When used with `robocorp-actions 0.1.0`, the `headers` can now be gotten in the `request`.
- Action server's public URL no longer changes on reconnection (with `--expose`).

## 0.0.28 - 2024-03-11

- `pydantic` models are accepted as the input and output of `@action`s.

- The action package name is now gotten from the `package.yaml` and not from the directory name
  (it's still gotten from the directory name when `conda.yaml` is used for backward compatibility).
- The action package name and action name are slugified to be ascii only and replace
  unwanted chars for `-` in the urls.
- A `--whitelist` argument is accepted in the command line for `start` and `import` and
  it allows whitelisting action package names as well as action names.

## 0.0.27 - 2024-03-04

- Same as 0.0.26, but had issues publishing the actual binary.

## 0.0.26 - 2024-03-01

  to disable linting).
  - `robocorp-actions 0.0.7` is now required.

## 0.0.19 - 2024-01-24

- Instead of defining a `conda.yaml` it's expected that an `action-server.yaml` is defined
  (at this point it's expected that it has the same contents as the `conda.yaml`).

## 0.0.16 - 2024-01-18

- If a process crashes while in the process pool idle processes it's not reused in a new run.
- When reusing processes, `@setup(scope="session")` is only called once and `@teardown(scope="session")` is no longer called.
  - Requires `robocorp-actions 0.0.6`.
  - Also fixes issue where files containing `@action` would be reimported on each new run when process is reused.

## 0.0.15 - 2024-01-16

- The `--api-key` is now checked in any calls, not just on the connection relative to the `--expose`.

  `--reuse-process`
- If the return of an `@action` does not conform to the proper return type a better error message is given.
- Improved keepalive/reconnection on the `--expose` tunnel (ping-pong messages).

## 0.0.13 - 2024-01-14

  Fixes issue where having long arguments could make the action invocation fail.

## 0.0.9 - 2024-01-08

- Fixed build issue (`rcc` should not be bundled in source release).

## 0.0.8 - 2024-01-08

- Properly depend on node 20.x when doing build.
- Trying to fix build issue (`rcc` should not be bundled in source release).

## 0.0.7 - 2024-01-08

- Make sure that `rcc` is not bundled when doing the source dist (otherwise the linux binary could be wrongly used in mac).
- UI revamp for the action server.
- When an action has default values it can be properly run without passing those as arguments.
- Updated template to start action server project.

## 0.0.6 - 2024-01-05

- `rcc` is now bundled in the action server wheel.
- When the action server is stopped, any subprocess is also killed.
- Pass `@action(is_consequential=True)` to add `x-openai-isConsequential` option to action openapi spec.
- Can be started with `--expose-allow-reuse` to reuse the previously exposed url.

## 0.0.5 - 2023-12-14

- Fixed issues in deployment:
  - `requests` is now a required dep (for --expose to work).
  - \_static_contents now properly added by poetry (because it was in .gitignore it was not added to the distribution).
  - "new" command properly checks that RCC is downloaded.
- Running an action with multiple `_` now works from the UI.

## 0.0.4 - 2023-12-13

- `action-server` is not defined as an entry point (so, after installing it,
  an `action-server` executable will be available to execute it instead of having
  to use `python -m robocorp-action-server`).
- Instead of just a text showing the trace header a hyperlink to the trace is also available.
- It's possible to bootstrap a project with `action-server new`.
- Improvements when exposing a server with `--expose`:
  - It's now possible to reuse a previously exposed session with `--expose-session`
  - An API key may be used with `--api-key` for authentication (`--api-key=None` can
    be used to disable authentication).
- By default, when the action server is started with `action-server start`, the
  current directory will be searched for actions and only those actions will be
  served (metadata will be stored in a datadir linked to the current folder).
- For more advanced cases, it's still possible to import actions specifying a
  custom datadir and then start the action server with `--actions-sync=false`
  specifying the proper datadir).

i.e.:

```
action-server import --dir=c:/temp=action-package1 --datadir=c:/temp/datadir
action-server import --dir=c:/temp=action-package2 --datadir=c:/temp/datadir
action-server start --actions-sync=false --datadir=c:/temp/datadir
```

- A text showing the trace header is now available in the logs.
- Other UI improvements.

## 0.0.2 - 2023-12-05

- Still pre-alpha.
- Internal DB migration available.
- Initial UI available.
  - Allows running from the UI.
  - Shows action packages, actions and runs.
  - The console and log.html can be seen.

  - Known issue: requests for runs and actions are cached and a full page request is needed to get new information.

## 0.0.1 - 2023-11-29

- First release (pre-alpha).
- Can import actions in the backend and run using API
