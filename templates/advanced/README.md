# Template: Advanced

The template showcases some more advanced configuration features of Actions.

The action enables you to get GitHub commit messages for given repository, using a personal access token. It uses [custom data model](https://github.com/Sema4AI/actions/blob/master/action_server/docs/guides/04-custom-data.md) for the repository information input.

ðŸš€ You can leverage the whole Python ecosystem when creating actions. Sema4.ai provides a [bunch of libraries](https://pypi.org/search/?q=robocorp-); you can make your own. The sky is the limit.

ðŸ‘‰ Check [Action Server](https://github.com/Sema4AI/actions/tree/master/action_server/docs) and [Actions](https://github.com/Sema4AI/actions/tree/master/actions/docs) docs for more information.
