# Functions

______________________________________________________________________

## `get_thread_id`

Get the thread ID from the action context or the request headers.

**Note:**

> This will raise an ActionError if the thread ID cannot be found. This is expected when calling this function directly from VSCode unless the `x-invoked_for_thread_id` header is set in the request in configured inputs.

[**Link to source**](https://github.com/sema4ai/actions/tree/master/actions/src/sema4ai/actions/agent/__init__.py#L147)

```python
get_thread_id() → str
```

______________________________________________________________________

## `get_agent_id`

Get the agent ID from the action context or the request headers.

**Note:**

> This will raise an ActionError if the agent ID cannot be found. This is expected when calling this function directly from VSCode unless the `x-invoked_by_assistant_id` header is set in the request in configured inputs.

[**Link to source**](https://github.com/sema4ai/actions/tree/master/actions/src/sema4ai/actions/agent/__init__.py#L158)

```python
get_agent_id() → str
```

______________________________________________________________________

## `prompt_generate`

Gives a prompt to an agent.

**Args:**

- <b>`prompt`</b>: The prompt to generate.

______________________________________________________________________

## `list_data_frames`

List all data frames available in the current thread.

**Returns:**
List of dataframe metadata dictionaries with keys:

**Raises:**

- <b>`ActionError`</b>: If called outside of an action context or if unable to fetch dataframes.

**Example:**

` from sema4ai.actions import action, agent`

````

```     dfs = agent.list_data_frames()```
```     return f"Found {len(dfs)} dataframes: {[df['name'] for df in dfs]}"```

:
This function requires the agent-server to support the dataframes API endpoint.
If the endpoint is not available, this will raise an ActionError.

`     total = sum(row[1] for row in sales_data.rows)`
`     return f"Total sales: ${total:,.2f}"`

**Note:**

> This function requires the agent-server to support the dataframes API endpoint. If the endpoint is not available, this will raise an ActionError.

[**Link to source**](https://github.com/sema4ai/actions/tree/master/actions/src/sema4ai/actions/agent/__init__.py#L269)

Can be True/False or pathto a CA bundle.endpoint_url: Alternative endpoint URL (e.g., for VPC endpoints or testing).Format: 'https://bedrock.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'aws_access_key_id: AWS access key. If not provided, boto3 will use theAWS configuration chain (environment, credentials file, IAM role).aws_secret_access_key: AWS secret key. Required if aws_access_key_idis provided.aws_session_token: Temporary session token for STS credentials.

Advanced Configuration: config_params: Used to instantiate a botocore.config.Config object foradvanced settings. Common options include:
\- retries: Dict controlling retry behavior (e.g., {'max_attempts': 3})
\- connect_timeout: Connection timeout in seconds
\- read_timeout: Read timeout in seconds
