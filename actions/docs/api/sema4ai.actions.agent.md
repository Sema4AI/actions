# Functions

______________________________________________________________________

## `get_thread_id`

Get the thread ID from the action context or the request headers.

**Note:**

> This will raise an ActionError if the thread ID cannot be found. This is expected when calling this function directly from VSCode unless the `x-invoked_for_thread_id` header is set in the request in configured inputs.

[**Link to source**](https://github.com/sema4ai/actions/tree/master/actions/src/sema4ai/actions/agent/__init__.py#L143)

```python
get_thread_id() → str
```

______________________________________________________________________

## `get_agent_id`

Get the agent ID from the action context or the request headers.

**Note:**

> This will raise an ActionError if the agent ID cannot be found. This is expected when calling this function directly from VSCode unless the `x-invoked_by_assistant_id` header is set in the request in configured inputs.

[**Link to source**](https://github.com/sema4ai/actions/tree/master/actions/src/sema4ai/actions/agent/__init__.py#L154)

```python
get_agent_id() → str
```

______________________________________________________________________

## `prompt_generate`

Gives a prompt to an agent.

**Args:**

- <b>`prompt`</b>: The prompt to generate.
- <b>`platform_config`</b>: The platform configuration if method is called without action context (optional).
- <b>`thread_id`</b>: The thread ID to use for the prompt (optional).
- <b>`agent_id`</b>: The agent ID to use for the prompt (optional).

**Note:**

> Either platform_config, thread_id or agent_id must be provided when calling this method without action context. The platform_config will be automatically obtained from the agent which is related to the thread_id or agent_id.

**Returns:**
JSON representation of the response from the agent.

# Class `BedrockPlatformParameters`

Parameters for the Bedrock platform.

This class encapsulates all configuration parameters for AWS Bedrock client initialization. It supports both direct client parameters and advanced configuration via the botocore Config object.

Direct Parameters: region_name: The AWS region to use (e.g., 'us-west-2', 'us-east-1').If not specified, boto3 will use the default region from AWS configuration.api_version: The API version to use. Generally should be left asNone to use the latest.use_ssl: Whether to use SSL when communicating with AWS (True by default).verify: Whether to verify SSL certificates. Can be True/False or pathto a CA bundle.endpoint_url: Alternative endpoint URL (e.g., for VPC endpoints or testing).Format: 'https://bedrock.us-east-1.amazonaws.com'aws_access_key_id: AWS access key. If not provided, boto3 will use theAWS configuration chain (environment, credentials file, IAM role).aws_secret_access_key: AWS secret key. Required if aws_access_key_idis provided.aws_session_token: Temporary session token for STS credentials.

Advanced Configuration: config_params: Used to instantiate a botocore.config.Config object foradvanced settings. Common options include:
\- retries: Dict controlling retry behavior (e.g., {'max_attempts': 3})
\- connect_timeout: Connection timeout in seconds
\- read_timeout: Read timeout in seconds
\- max_pool_connections: Max connections to keep in connection pool
\- proxies: Dict of proxy servers to use

\- inject_host_prefix: Whether to inject host prefix into endpoint

**Examples:**
Basic usage with region:

```python
params = BedrockPlatformParameters(region_name='us-east-1')
```

Using custom endpoint and credentials:

```python
params = BedrockPlatformParameters(
    endpoint_url='https://bedrock.custom.endpoint',
