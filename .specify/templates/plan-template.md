# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.github/prompts/speckit.plan.prompt.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [ ] **Principle I — Library-First Action Design**: Identify the library/module boundary, public surface, and reuse plan
  (documented in plan + spec). Explain why the feature cannot live inside another existing library.
- [ ] **Principle II — CLI & HTTP-First Interface**: Enumerate required CLI commands and HTTP endpoints (or explicitly
  state "N/A" with justification). Confirm outputs are machine-readable (JSON) and human-readable.
- [ ] **Principle III — Test-First**: List the failing tests that will be authored before implementation (unit, contract,
  integration). Link to corresponding tasks and describe the trigger that makes them fail initially.
- [ ] **Principle IV — Contract & Integration Testing**: Capture schema/versioning implications and how compatibility will
  be enforced (migration plan or breaking-change rationale).
- [ ] **Principle V — Vendored Builds & Reproducible Releases**: If vendoring is required, include justification, build
  command, manifest responsibilities, and checksum validation plan. If not required, state "No vendored artifacts".
- [ ] **Runtime & Tooling Constraint**: Confirm Python 3.11.x (or approved alternative) and declare package environment
  definition path (`package.yaml`).
- [ ] **Licensing & Security**: Note third-party dependencies, license scan impact, and any security review or threat
  model checkpoints.
- [ ] **Observability**: Describe structured logging/telemetry requirements and guardrails against leaking secrets.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
